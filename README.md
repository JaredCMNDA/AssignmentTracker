# AssignmentTracker
This is the repo for a simple tracker that allowed me to learn the implementation of JSON with C++. I used this to understand streams, and their different properties within the char stream and file stream



This is also the first release branch for this project. I don't really know why you're here, but hey, go ahead and look at the project and challenge yourself to understand my terrible level of thinking!
